# Education-Inequality
This project aims to tackle the issue of unequal access to education in American high schools by concentrating on the typical performance of students in the ACT or SAT examinations, which are crucial components of college admission requirements. The primary source of information utilized is the EdGap data set, sourced from [EdGap.org](https://www.edgap.org/#5/37.875/-96.987), which features data from 2016 encompassing the average ACT or SAT scores of schools, along with various socio-economic indicators of the school district. The secondary data set consists of fundamental details regarding each school, acquired from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).
